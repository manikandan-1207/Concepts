# Concepts

The directory includes the step by step document of set up the Apache tomcat application server , Jenkins CI/CD tool, Maven Tool, Git git hub, AWS and some more...

In the text file /concept/'Tomcat Server'/'Tomcat server guide.txt' I have clearly note down the entire steps to create the Apache tomcat -9 application server along with how to configure the tomcat server.
